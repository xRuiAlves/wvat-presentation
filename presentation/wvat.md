# What is WVAT

WVAT is an **open-source** CLI tool to analyse a domain, its subdomains and respective pages, extracting the used technologies to find their **vulnerabilities** in order to cross-reference them with known exploits.

To perform these tasks, various different tools are used! We'll get to that later.

# Some Context

This project was proposed as part of the Software Development Lab course @MIEIC, FEUP (4th year, 1st semestre course).

The proposers were **João Pedro Dias**, **Pedro Sousa** and **Luís Catarino** (special props to **João Pedro Dias**, who helped us a lot during development), security professionals and/or enthusiasts, as they realised that there was no similar aggregated solution for the problems this tool solves.

**Side Note:** The [**LDSO course**](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=436457) allows random people to propose projects for students to tackle. You can contact the course's teachers if you have a project to propose (you can talk to me after the presentation for more info)
